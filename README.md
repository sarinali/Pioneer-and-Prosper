## **Pioneer and Prosper**


(Team 4 submission)

Official github submission of team 4 from Markham x Illuminate Pioneer and Prosper case competition. 

#### Following includes:
- 3D graph of traffic accidents in Hanoi by longitude and latitude
- Digit recognition using scikit learn
- Dijkstra implementation by distance+congestion

#### Installation guide

 1. You will need and IDE to run our console based code files. For the java file, we recommend [ECLIPSE](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/), you can access the version downloads there. As for python, we used [IDLE](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/). For this project, we ask that you download python3 to aid with complimentary module installations. 
 2. For the java file, you will need to copy it into your [eclipse workspace](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/eclipse/eclipse-introduction-and-installation/#:~:text=A%20workspace%20is%20a%20location,application%20remembers%20your%20past%20work.). From there, take the information from our node info and run it in your console.
 3. Unfortunately, installations for python files will be slightly more difficult. 
	- **For windows users:** open your command prompt and paste in the following: `py -m pip --version`. If you do not have pip installed, please visit their [documentation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) and install as directed.
	- Now that you have pip installed, enter the following command prompts: `py -m pip install matplotlib`, `py -m install numpy`, `py -m install pandas` and `py -m pip install scikit-learn`. This will allow you to run our code files which use these two modules. 
	- **For MacOS users**: similar to Windows users, check your pip version with the command `python -m pip --version` in your terminal application. 
	- Installation commands are `pip3 install matplotlib`, `pip3 install pandas`, `pip3 install scikit-learn` and `pip3 install numpy`.
4. Finally, we included all the files you will need to run our code in our folders. Check the files folder for all the csv data. For these, you will need the local path on your computer and then you will need to paste this path where we have pasted our local path. 
5. Now, you can run the code!
